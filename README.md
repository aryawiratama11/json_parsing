# json_parsing

These app is showing how to use json api in a flutter application.Json refers to javascript object notation.in this application, I had used json placeholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and calling the data in a customized list view which include a listtile and other widgets too. when a user clicks on a particular item a dialog box will appear showing the title which has been fetched from placeholder API.
